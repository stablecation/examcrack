## ⚡ Setup after cloning / migrating

The `.env` files are intentionally **gitignored**, so they don't ship with the repo.
After every fresh clone or platform migration, regenerate them in one command:

```bash
bash setup.sh
sudo supervisorctl restart backend frontend
```

This creates `backend/.env` (Mongo URL, DB name, a freshly generated `JWT_SECRET`, CORS)
and `frontend/.env` (auto-detected `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`). Existing `.env` files are
left untouched. See `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example` for the required keys.

> If login shows *"something went wrong"* right after a migration, it almost always means
> the `.env` files are missing — just run `bash setup.sh`.
